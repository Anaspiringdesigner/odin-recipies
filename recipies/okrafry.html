    <h3 class="hef3">Description</h3>

    <p class="box1">
        The okra is a delicacy in many regions of central asia and the Middle east. 
        (info is based on people's preferences who are from those places). It is hailed
        as the queen of vegetables and has numerous nutritional values. A single good 
        serving can fill you up! Such is the power of Okra. It is easy to cook, but it
        needs some amount of preparation. Even if you are a complete beginner, you can 
        attempt to cook okra and succeed with a high probability of success. Like many 
        other traditional dishes, Okra can also be cooked in multiple ways. The current 
        one is the way of frying.
    </p>

    <p class="box1">
        The cooking method is almost similar to some other Fry dishes that are on the,
        website, but it's taste and delicacy is unparalleled. It has high fibre content
        which is good for the gut health. With okra, one needs to choose the ingredients 
        carefully as to not ruin the taste of the final dish. One also needs to pay 
        attention to the preparation of okra to avoid it's inherent stickiness. Let's dive 
        into the dish without any further ado!

            <li>Wait 3-4 mins for the pan to get heated, before adding the oil of your choice to the pan</li>
            <li>Wait for another 3-4 mins for the oil to heat up and then add the okra pieces to the pan</li>
            <li>Put a lid on the pan and wait for 10 mins</li>
