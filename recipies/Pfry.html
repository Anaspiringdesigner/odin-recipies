    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the potatoes and chop them into small pieces. The smaller the piece, the faster the cooking time</li>
            <li>Take your frying pan and place it on the hob or the stove after turning on the stove</li>
            <li>Set the hot power to 6 and the stove to medium high.</li>
            <li>Let the pan heat for a couple of mins (3-4 mins)</li>
            <li>Based on the amount of Potato's that are being fried (not to completely submerge the pieces, but just enough to form a layer at the base), add the oil of your choice proportionately</li>
            <li>Let the oil heat up for a while (3-4 mins)</li>
            <li>Now add the chopped potatoes into the heated oil pan.</li>
            <li>Leave it for 8-10 mins after placing a lid on top of the pan</li>
            <li>Using the Spatula, mix the potatoes so that the ones at the bottom come up, and the ones at the top go to the bottom</li>
            <li>For the next 10 mins, keep repeating the above step for every 2 mins</li>
            <li>After the duration is over, add cumin seeds/powder and turmeric powder to the pan and mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>After 5 more  mins, check if the pieces are soft and tasty, if yes, then add salt and let it heat up for more mins. Mix thoroughly after adding salt</li>
            <li>Now, Add the chopped peppers to the fray along with salt.</li>
            <li>After the time is done, taste a piece and then see what's missing and add</li>
            <li>That's it, your potato fry is ready to be served.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

            <li>Try eating with multiple things like rice, naan, roti, etc..</li>
        </ul>
