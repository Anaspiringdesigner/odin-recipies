    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Lentil soup is a very famous dish in middle east and south asia (especially India)
        It has good protein content and is widely consumed with dishes like Potato fry, and
        Okra fry to have a balanced diet. It has a longer preparation and cooking times than
        that of the ones that of the fries that are on this page. It clearly has high
        nutritional value and is of great taste. It's taste, when cooked properly is impeccable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Red Lentils are very highly consumed in the Sub-continent. They are of extremely high
        nutritional value and are widely grown, so that a fresh supply is consistently available.
        Adding tomato to these Red Lentils is a traditional way of cooking them such that the taste
        of red lentils, which is starch like, doesn't dominate the dish. A lot more ingredients are 
        required to make this dish and without any further ado, let's get into the fray.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, take two fist full of red lentil and soak it in drinking water for 20-30 mins</li>
            <li>At 20mins of soaking, wash the fresh salad tomatoes and cut them into small pieces</li>
            <li>now, drain the soaking water and add a half glass of water to the pressure cooker. If you did not soak in the pressure cooker kindly shift everything to the pressure Cooker</li>
            <li>Dump these tomatoes into the pressure cooker, cut some chillies or peppers into small pieces along the axis of the pepper and add then to the pressure cooker</li>
            <li>Now, seal the lid of the pressure cooker tightly and place it on the hob or the stove. for hob, set the power to 9, and for stove set it to high</li>
            <li>Wait for the whistles of the pressure cooker. we need 5 for Lentil. <strong>A word of caution is that the pressure cooker's whistle's will not stop automatically at 5, one needs to constantly monitor it to ensure it doesn't blast. Leaving it unattended could lead it ot blast.</strong></li>
            <li>while waiting, take a small amount of tamarind paste into a bowl (golf ball size) and soak it in water</li>
            <li>Once the whistles are done, let it cool down and with for the pressure inside to settle down before opening the lid.<strong>Note that if the pressure is too high and the vessel is too hot, the lid will not open no matter how hard you try.</strong></li>
            <li>Even after opening the lid, the contents inside will be very hot. Wait a little more to make sure that the temperature is at an acceptable level and hand blend the contents of the cooker</li>
            <li>Once, the blending with a hand blender is done, place the pressure cooker on a hob or a stove and set the power of the hob to 6 and the stove to medium high </li>
            <li>Now, it's time to add some water based on the number of fists of lentil. We took two fists, so we add 1.5 glasses of water</li>
            <li>From the soaked tamarind paste, mix it completely and remove the sediments and add the mixture to the pot</li>
            <li>Now add the Turmeric powder. Be generous while adding this</li>
            <li>Add the cumin seeds/powder to the pot, and also be generous</li>
            <li>Take the fresh coriander and add it to the pot as it is after washing it</li>
            <li>Take small piece of ginger and 2-3 garlic pieces and blend them into a paste</li>
            <li>Let the pot boil for a while (5-10 mins)</li>
            <li>After it gets boiled well, take the frying pan and heat it for 3-4 mins before adding oil</li>
            <li>Add oil and let it heat up for 3-4 mins</li>
            <li>Add a spoon of split chick peas, a spoon of black mustard seeds, a spoon of Urad beans, and let then saute for 2-3 mins</li>
            <li>After the saute, add the garlic-ginger paste, add a half spoon of Asafoetida, and add 4-6 dry chillies based on your spice
                tolerance
            </li>
            <li>Now let this saute till the dry chillies become brittle and dark</li>
            <li>Once the dry chillies are dark, add the mixture to the pot of the lentil soup and stir deeply.</li>
            <li>After the deep stir, let the pot boil for 10 mins before taking it out.</li>
            <li>That's it, your dish is ready to rumble your grumbling tummy, yummy yummy!!</li>
